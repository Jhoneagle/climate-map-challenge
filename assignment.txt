First think was to reapply react dependcies alpha version which went for previous version during install. After that when it finally worked there was problem of markers being totally of the places because they had their x and y position mixed. So basically I just switched them with each other.

Then when the markers were in right places I started refactoring the project. First of all i moved css styling to own folder because they are separate from everything else. Also I moved locationGetter and serviceWorker to utils folder as they are just small supportive parts of the program. Then after that I extracted rendering of the map itself to own component. This is because it's quite large even by itself and it makes it lot more easier to edit without touching rest of the program as its already independed component. 

After doing refactoring I started working with sidebar and made it use weather information that was gotten from API. It now displays current and days highest and lowest temprature, if there is snow in the ground and what is its depth and amount of rain during last hour and day. Which are separated into their own small components to make sidebar component more readable. Also it's commented from begging where it parses the information from the json.

Now there is also tooltip added to the markers to tell name of the marker.So that it's easier to select one you want as you don't have to guess.
